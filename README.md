 Fibonaccier: This program reads positive (>0) number n from user and maskes 2 async calls to a function fib(...) which
 - a) includes a random delay of up to 1 second
- b) calculates and returns the fibonacci number calculated
using the following recursive formula:
  Fib(0) = 0
  Fib(1) = 1
  Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)

Print out the resulting Fibonacci number Fib(n)
